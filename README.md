## Usage
Run `index.js` with 1-2 Node environment variables.
- TEST_SCRIPT - the script that registers start and end times, runs your code and outputs the delta time to stdout
- TEST_RUNS - number of times your TEST_SCRIPT will be run. The higher the number the slower the test, but more accurate the results.
